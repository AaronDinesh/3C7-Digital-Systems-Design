2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell dut/reg2_reg[5]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) dut/reg2_reg[0]/CLR, dut/reg2_reg[1]/CLR, dut/reg2_reg[2]/CLR, dut/reg2_reg[3]/CLR, dut/reg2_reg[4]/CLR, dut/reg2_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
